# Visualization based on [Steadiness & Cohesiveness](https://github.com/hj-n/steadiness-cohesiveness#methods) [and reliability map](https://github.com/hj-n/snc-reliability-map)

Check original repo for detailed usage.

Educational implementation for IN4310 Seminar Computer Graphics (2024/25 Q1).

Sampled 5000 points from MNIST dataset, precaculate t-SNE with different perplexities (Same random space).

Scroll to see different perplexity results.

Flowchart for better understanding of cluster distorsions and its relation with perplexity. Click on distorsion to see the corresponding t-SNE map.
